collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2014-01-hvc
excerpt: 'This work demonstrates how finite-state protocols (i.e., protocols where the communicating agents do not have internal state variables) could be synthesized starting from a set of execution fragments of the protocol, together with a set of high-level temporal logic requirements.'
