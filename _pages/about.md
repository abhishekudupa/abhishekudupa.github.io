I'm a researcher working on making program synthesis technologies available to the masses (unwashed or otherwise). I work with an awesome group of people in the [PROSE](https://microsoft.github.io/prose/) group at Microsoft.
Apart from program synthesis, I'm also interested in (an occasionally dabble in) applied verification, model checking and programming language research.

I graduated with a Ph.D. from the [University of Pennsylvania](http://cis.upenn.edu/index.php), where I was advised by [Rajeev Alur](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/). My dissertation explored techniques to automatically synthesize
distrubuted protocols from a mix of formal and informal specifications. The [SyGuS](http://www.sygus.org/index.html) initiative was a happy by-product of my dissertation research.
