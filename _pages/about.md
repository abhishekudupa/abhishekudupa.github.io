I'm a researcher working on making program synthesis technologies available to the masses (unwashed or otherwise). I work with an awesome group of people in the [PROSE](https://microsoft.github.io/prose/) group at Microsoft.
Apart from program synthesis, I'm also interested in (an occasionally dabble in) applied verification, model checking and programming language research.
